 The name and the optional description have no special meaning to Cucumber. 
 Their purpose is to provide a place for you to document important aspects of the feature, such as a brief explanation and a list of business rules (general acceptance criteria).

The free format description for 
Feature ends when you start a line with the keyword Background, 
Rule, Example or Scenario Outline (or their alias keywords).
