#When steps are used to describe an event, or an action. 
#This can be a person interacting with the system, 
#or it can be an event triggered by another system.
# It’s strongly recommended you only have a single When step per Scenario.
# If you feel compelled to add more, 
#it’s usually a sign that you should split the scenario up into multiple scenarios.
