# Occasionally youâ€™ll find yourself repeating the same 
# Given steps in all of the scenarios in a Feature.
# Since it is repeated in every scenario, this is an indication that those steps are not essential to describe the scenarios;
# they are incidental details. You can literally move such Given steps to the background, 
# by grouping them under a Background section.
# A Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it. It can contain one or more Given steps, 
# which are run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks.
# A Background is placed before the first Scenario/Example, at the same level of indentation.
